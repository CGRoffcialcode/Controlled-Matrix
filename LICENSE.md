**TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of this License.

  "Copyright" means copyright as defined by applicable law.

  "The Program" refers to any work of authorship, of any kind, and in
  any medium, that contains this Notice. "Part" means a work of authorship
  that was included in the Program as a whole when this Notice was first
  included in the Program and that continues to be included in the Program.
  A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any other work
  containing a Part and either more than or less than the corresponding
  Part of the Program. "Derivative Works" are sometimes called
  "modified versions" or "variations" of the Program.

  The "License" applies to any reproduction or distribution of the Program
  or a work based on the Program.

  A "contributor" is anyone who distributes copies of the Program or a
  work based on it or who publicly announces their intention to do so.

  "Distribute" means to make the Program available (or copies thereof) to
  others, whether by publication in tangible form, by distribution of copies
  in information storage devices, or by any other means (including, but not
  limited to, electronic transmission).

1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of
  a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that is either:

    * defined by an open and publicly available specification that
      describes the means of interaction with a computerized work
      using computer languages, or
    * a widely used and publicly known interface that has an open and
      publicly available description.

2. Basic Permissions.

  All copyright is hereby assigned to the Free Software Foundation.

  You may copy and distribute copies of the Program, with or without
  modification, under the terms of this License.

  You may modify the Program or parts of it and distribute any resulting
  work under the terms of this License.

  Any work that you distribute or publish, in source code form or
  otherwise, that is based on the Program must:

    * contain this Notice prominently placed,
    * contain a list of all contributors to the Program, and
    * indicate that changes were made to the Program.

3. Protecting Users' Freedoms.

  If you modify the Program, you must cause the modified files to carry
  prominent notices stating that you changed them and the date of any
  change.

  You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that is based
  on the Program, to carry prominent notices stating that it is based on
  the Program and listing the original authors, and any subsequent
  authors who have modified the Program.

  You must acknowledge the use of the Program in the documentation and/or
  other materials provided with the distribution and in the display of
  credits for the Program if such credits are normally provided.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise
  of the rights granted herein. You may not require recipients to accept
  any additional terms as a condition to exercising these rights.

  You may not remove or alter this Notice.

4. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you distribute or publish a work that contains the Program, or a
  work based on the Program, on a medium that can or does contain computer
  code, you must ensure that, in addition to the other terms of this
  License, the recipient has the means to receive the source code of any
  Part contained in that work on a physical medium if you deliver the
  object code of that Part in physical form.

  If you distribute or publish a work that contains the Program, or a
  work based on the Program, in object code form, you must make
  available, together with the object code, either:

    * the source code for the entire work, or
    * a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any
      conveyance of the object code this License also to give the
      recipient of the object code, upon request, the corresponding
      source code. This offer must be exercised within a reasonable
      time after the receipt of a request.

  You may not offer or impose any terms on the recipient of the object
  code except one: that the recipient not itself distribute or publish
  the object code without also making available the source code to it
  as described above.

  (This is interpreted to mean that any work that contains objects
  code from the Program must offer both the object code and the
  source code.)

5. Combining Duplication and Distribution.

  You may combine or produce a derivative work from this Program or a
  work based on the Program, and you may distribute copies of the
  resulting work under the terms of this License, with the exception
  that you must cause the resulting work to carry the provisions of
  Sections 1 through 7, identified as being from this License, and
  that you must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
  is based on the Program, to carry prominent notices stating that
  you modified it, and the date of any change.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  If you distribute or publish a library, or any other work that contains
  parts of the Program in object code form, you must be prepared to
  make the source code for the parts you distributed or published
  available to users. You must inform users that they can obtain the
  source code from you. If you give users the opportunity to connect
  with you through computer networks, your offer must state the means
  of obtaining the source code from you. You may charge a reasonable
  fee for the cost of distribution, packaging, or handling.

7. Additional Terms.

  Neither party may impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
  exercise of the rights granted herein. Neither party may require
  licensees to accept any additional terms as a condition to exercising
  these rights.

8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
  permitted under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
  this License (including any patent licenses), and your obligations
  under this License (including any patent license obligations).

  This termination will not affect any other licenses that this License
  may grant you under the terms of the Program itself. When you
  terminate your rights under this License, you must cease all
  propagation and modification of the covered work and all works
  based on the Program. However, your obligations under this License
  that arose before the termination will continue in force.

  This License will terminate if and only if you violate any of its
  terms. Should the License terminate, this entire document, including
  the termination provision, will be null and void.

9. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  **THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
  IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
  NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.**

10. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
  ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
  PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
  USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
  DATA OR LOSS OF PROFITS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

11. Interpretation.

  This License does not limit your rights under copyright law to use.
