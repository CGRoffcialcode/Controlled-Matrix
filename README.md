### THERE IS NO SUPPORT FOR LINUX or MAC YET. USING TOOLS IN LINUX MAY GIVE UNDESIRED RESULTS (I have no idea baccically)
# How to set up
* Download as zip file, or clone the repository
* Then, go to ***exe (runtime here)*** and take *main.exe* and run it in ***File explorer***.
* This is how Controlled Matrix works!
Now, you can choose between a screensaver, and a wallpaper

# Wallpaper
* Just generate a video and bring it over as a wallpaer using ***Lively Wallpaper*** or ***Wallpaper engine (please add watermark if u are going to share it)***
* Or with the terminal setitngs below, run the exe and using ***Transulecent TB*** you can make an effective wallpaper without a application
##### (Settings for TB): Desktop (Clear) Visible window (Clear) Start opened (blur or clear)

# Screensaver
* Take *main.scr* and place it in System32
* Then open ***Change screen saver*** (search it up) 
* Now select main
# Next, go to terminal (terminal settings for nice wallpaper background)
* Go to startup
* Select Launch parameters
* Select Full screen on launch mode 

# You're done!


### Example video given, (mixed v2 wth watermark) (i recommend you use it becuase you need a NASA computer to generate it without it taking a year ðŸ˜­)
