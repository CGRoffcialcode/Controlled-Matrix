# How to set up
* First, go to ***exe (runtime here)*** and take *main.exe* and run it in a console.
* This is how Controlled Matrix works!
Now, you can choose between a screensaver, and a wallpaper
* Wallpaper needs setup, as I don't yet know how to set it up

# Screensaver
* Take *main.scr* and place it in System32
* Then open ***Change screen saver*** (search it up) 
* Now select main
Next, go to terminal
* Go to startup
* Select Launch parameters
* Select Full screen on launch mode 

# You're done!
